xSub Replication Code {#xsub-replication-code .unnumbered}
=====================

This repository contains R code to replicate all data files at
<http://www.x-sub.org>.

-   xSub version 1.0, February 2018.

System Requirements
===================

Successful execution of xSub replication scripts requires:

-   4-core processor, 16 GB RAM (recommended: 16-core, 64 GB RAM)

-   Linux operating system (tested on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS, 64-bit)

-   user account with read/write privileges

-   R installation (tested on R version 3.4.3)

-   GDAL installation (tested on GDAL 1.11.3)

-   R packages (installs automatically if missing):
    `gdata, countrycode, maptools, foreign, plotrix, sp, raster, rgeos, spatstat, parallel, foreach`

Compilation is also possible with a Windows operating system, but user
will need to manually replace parallelization routines from the
`parallel` R package with analogous routines from `foreach` (currently
commented-out in the code).

Workspace
=========

This repository contains several directories for input and output xSub
data files, and code. Users should clone the following directory
structure prior to executing R scripts.

-   `/Code`\
    (event extraction, classification and aggregation code)

-   `/Dictionaries`\
    (actor and event dictionaries)

-   `/Input`\
    (not included in GitHub repository)\
    (all input data files, various formats)

    -   `/Input/Events`\
        (violent event data)

    -   `/Input/GIS directory`\
        (raw data for control variables, GIS layers, borders, etc.)

-   `/Output`\
    (not included in GitHub repository)\
    (intermediate output data files **not** created for website upload,
    csv format)

    -   `/Output/Output_XXX`\
        (aggregated event counts from data source XXX)

    -   `/Output/Output_Covariates`\
        (aggregated control variables, various sources)

-   `/Data/Upload`\
    (not included in GitHub repository)\
    (output data files created for website upload, csv format)

    -   `/Upload/data_csv_country`\
        (aggregated event counts, .csv format, by country, by source)

Overview of Code
================

The process of converting raw input datasets into web-ready aggregates
entails five steps:

1.  **Actor and action dictionaries** (`Code/step1_dictionary/`).
    Because each data source uses a unique actor and action typology,
    xSub uses a separate dictionary for each conflict and source to map
    disparate actors mentioned in event reports to our categories of
    `SIDEA`, `SIDEB`, `SIDEC`, `SIDED`, and to map reported actions to
    our categories of `ANY`, `SEL`, `IND`, `PRT`.

    -   <span>*To create your own actor and event dictionaries*</span>:
        For each data source that requires an actor dictionary (e.g.
        GED, SCAD, etc.), there is a corresponding script
        (`step1_dictionary_GED.R`, `step1_dictionary_SCAD.R`, etc.),
        which runs through every actor mentioned in the raw data, and
        queries the user to specify whether the actor
        is government/rebel/civilian/other. xSub uses a different source
        code (`step1_dictionary_EventType.R`) to similarly create a
        multi-source action dictionary from event descriptions in the
        raw text data.

    -   <span>*To use pre-existing xSub dictionaries*</span>: skip this
        step and proceed to step 2.

2.  **Event coding and aggregation** (`Code/step2_eventcode/`). Once an
    actor dictionary for a data source is created, the next step is to
    classify individual events and aggregate them to consistent
    spatio-temporal units of analysis. For each data source, there is a
    set of (usually) two aggregation scripts:

    1.  `step2_eventcode1_XXX.R`: Code to classify events by actor and
        tactics, using dictionaries created in step 1.

    2.  `step2_eventcode2_XXX.R`: Code to sum individual events by
        administrative unit (country, province, district) or PRIO grid
        cell, and unit of time (year, month, week, day), and write
        aggregate event counts to file, for each country and level of
        aggregation, in RData format.

3.  **Covariate coding and aggregation** (`Code/step3_covariates/`). In
    addition to violent events, xSub also includes data on political,
    socio-economic, ethno-linguistic and geographic covariates, for each
    country, at each level of analysis. This process can proceed
    independently of event coding (steps 1 and 2), and is governed by
    the code `step3_covariates_parallel.R` (also,
    `step3_weather_parallel.R`). Most of the raw data used in this step
    are in the format of GIS shapefiles or raster images, with global
    coverage. This code creates boundary shapefiles corresponding to
    each spatial level of analysis – administrative unit (country,
    province, district) or PRIO grid cell – and calculates summary
    statistics for the relevant covariates within each spatial unit. It
    writes the output data to file, for each country and level of
    aggregation, in RData format.

4.  **Merge and export** (`Code/step4_merge/`, depends on
    `Code/step4x_variable_select.R`). The file `step4_merge1.R` merges
    the event counts with covariates, for each country and level of
    analysis, and writes the individual country files to disk. The
    `step4_merge2.R` script concatenates the individual files into a
    large matrix, for each data source and level of aggregation, and
    writes the file to disk, in csv format. These are the processed csv
    files that are uploaded to the xSub server for public use.

5.  **Maps and graphics** (`Code/step5_maps/`). In addition to event
    coding, aggregation and merging files, we include scripts to
    replicate the data visualizations featured on the xSub website
    (`step5_maps.R`).

Input Data Sources
==================

Note that, due to file size and usage restrictions, the repository
currently provides empty directories for input and output data files. To
replicate xSub data, users will need to obtain the original data from
third-party sources, and place them into their corresponding
subdirectories in the `/Input` folder.
